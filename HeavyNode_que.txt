You are given a tree with N nodes rooted at 1. Each of the N nodes have some special number S, related to It. Each Node also has
certain Power Power of each node of the tree is defined as the number of heavy nodes in the subtree of the node (including that node). A
heavy node is a node whose sum of divisors of its special number is a multiple of 3. You are given Q queries.
There are two types of queries:
Type 1: Update special number of node.
Type 2: Tell the power of a certain node.

INPUT FORMAT:

First line: Two space separated integers N and Q denoting number of nodes in the tree and number of queries respectively.
Each of the next N - 1 lines: Two space separated integers U and V denoting there is an edge between them.
Next line: N space separated integers, i of which denotes the special number related to node i.
First integer in next Q lines is T (the type of query.
if T is 1, it is followed by 2 integers X and Y denoting special number of node X is to be updated to Y
If T is 2, it is followed by single integer X.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

For each query of type 2 output the power of the given node X
Answer for each query should come in a new line

EXPLANATION:

Out of Special Numbers 16, 8, 17,3 and 18 only 8,17 and 18 have sum of divisors divisible by 3
So subtree of node 1 has 3 heavy nodes and hence power is 3 and subtree of node 3 has 2 heavy nodes and hence power is 2
When we update special number of node 3 from 17 to 7 (sum of divisors of 7 which is 1+7 8 is not multiple of 3)
We get answer for same queries as 2 and 1 as 1 heavy node has decreased in number from both subtrees.
